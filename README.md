# scosu-rpc
A custom Discord Rich Presence (RPC) for the scosu! private server.

## Requirements:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads)

## Configuration:
This project contains a `config.py` file in which you can change the `username` to your scosu! username to show your stats on a button or set the path to your `gosumemory.exe` in order to run it along with the rpc.

## How to run:
- Open a terminal in the same folder with all the files
- Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the needed dependencies
- Run `python main.py` to start the rpc
